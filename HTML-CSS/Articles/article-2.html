    <!-- ARTICLE DESCRIPTION IN BOLD -->
    <p class="article-2-description">Fernando Alonso returned to the podium for the first time since Zandvoort in the Sao Paulo Grand Prix, claiming P3 in a frantic drag race to the line with Sergio Perez – with Lance Stroll adding to Aston Martin’s joy with a strong drive to P5.</p>

        <p>Alonso spent much of the latter half of the Interlagos race resisting pressure from Perez in the all-conquering Red Bull RB19. But when the Mexican slipped past for third place at Turn 1 on Lap 70 of 71, it looked as though Alonso’s brave defence wasn’t to be rewarded with a podium.</p>
    
        <p>But on the final tour, Alonso eschewed a challenge into Turn 1 on Perez, focusing instead on a DRS-assisted move down to Turn 4. That pass pulled off, he then managed to out-drag Perez to the line, claiming P3 by just 0.053s from the Mexican.</p>
    
        <p>“For me it was like 30 laps that I had the pressure from Checo [Perez],” said Alonso, who started the Grand Prix in P4. “But when he passed me two laps to the end, I thought, 'Okay, this is gone, the podium is not possible anymore.' But he braked a little bit late into [Turn] 1, and I said, 'Okay, I go for it into [Turn] 4.’</p>
    
        <p>“This is a phenomenal result for the team,” added Alonso, who retired from the previous two events in Austin and Mexico City. “We've been struggling for a couple of months already, especially the last two events with two retirements. So this podium is for them, for everybody in the factory. We keep fighting until the last lap.”</p>
